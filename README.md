### Description

[@Weather App](https://github.com/AlexandruAndrita/WeatherApp) is a GUI application which provides the user with the weather for a certain city. 

Additionally, other information like air pressure, humidity, wind direction&speed or sunset&sunrise times are displayed. <br/>
The entry widget is validated in case the name of the city is not valid: if it contains other characters than letters or the city itself does not exist e.g. wrong word spelling or random letter thrown there.

- The validation part &#8594; the "Show weather" button is enabled only if the location is valid
  - if the app displays "Location available" colored in green, then the name of the city is valid
